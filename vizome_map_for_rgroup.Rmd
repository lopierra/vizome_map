## Background on mapping in R

There's a whole field of data science around geospatial analysis using GIS (geographic information systems).

Examples - weather patterns, real estate prices, crime incidence, etc.

At its core, a map in R is just a plot of latitude vs longitude.

Mapping uses "shapefiles" - predetermined collections of coordinates indicating boundaries of things like states, counties, neighbourhoods, voting districts, etc. A map in which these shapes are shaded/coloured to show differences in data is called a *choropleth map*. 

If you want to do "real" geospatial analysis, use {ggmap} package. It can pull in map data from Google Maps and other services and make them look nice.

* A good tutorial: https://www.littlemissdata.com/blog/maps
* Short example I did for a previous project: https://github.com/lopierra/biketown

For our recent grant application, I just needed to make a simple map of US states, so I used the {fiftystater} package, which is a bit easier to learn than {ggmap}.

* Source: https://github.com/wmurphyrd/fiftystater
* It's basically just a dataframe of lat/long coordinates for state boundaries, plus some additional metadata to create a map of the US.

## Background on my project

Part of this grant was about disseminating Vizome to the cancer research community for increased adoption.

We wanted to create some sort of map that would show our range of influence across the country through our membership in various NCI and other networks.

Rather than trying to manually draw things on a map, it seemed like R would be the quickest and easiest solution. I had already used {fiftystater} for something similar, so I went with that.

First step was to envision what I wanted:

* States colored by number of network member centers in each
* Specific points showing locations of our actual collaborators on the grant

## Data collection and Excel cleaning

**1. Center data**

I started by putting together an Excel sheet of all of the members of the networks we participate in, and what state they're in.
I basically just copied and pasted from the following sources:

- U54 DSRN: https://ncihub.org/groups/drsn
- CTD2: https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/ctd2/centers
- CTSA (CD2H): https://ncats.nih.gov/files/ctsa-funding-information.pdf
  - click on Hub awards for 2019 (60 UL1 awards), export from NIH RePORTER
- NCI-Designated Cancer Centers (CI4CC): https://cancercenters.cancer.gov/Center/CCList

**2. Collaborator data**

I also put together a separate sheet with the coordinates for our collaborators.

* Since there weren't very many, I just looked them up on Google Maps (right click -> "What's here?") and then copied & pasted the lat/long info.
* With a longer list, there are probably better ways to do this, like maybe with ggmap or doing some sort of web scraping, but I had to balance the amount of time spent learning how to automate something with the time it would take to just do it.

Similarly, since my dataset is very small and I can read pretty fast, I did a bunch of cleaning directly in Excel since I didn't have time to figure it out in R:

* Manually type in state for each center
* Many centers appeared more than once but with slightly different names -> sort by name, pick one spelling (didn't matter which) and copy & paste so all are the same 

## Data wrangling in R

Read in center and collaborator location data using {readxl}
```{r}
data <- readxl::read_xlsx("centers.xlsx")
point_data <- readxl::read_xlsx("partner_coords.xlsx")
```

Clean up center data:

* {fiftystater} refers to states using their full name, all lowercase (e.g. "oregon")
* My dataset contains two-letter state abbreviations, so I need to convert them all to lowercase state names
* `state` is a dataset built into R (like `iris` or `mtcars`)
* I used `state` to make a lookup table containing state names (`state.name`) and abbreviations (`state.abb`)
* I also added a custom row for DC, since it's not in the `state` dataset
```{r}
state_lookup <- data.frame(state.abb, 
                           state = tolower(state.name), 
                           stringsAsFactors = F) %>% 
  rbind(c("DC", "district of columbia"))
```

Then I used the lookup table to add full state names to my centers dataframe
```{r}
centers <- data %>% 
  left_join(state_lookup, by = c("state_abb" = "state.abb"))

# make center names lowercase for consistency
centers$center <- tolower(centers$center)
```

## Format data for mapping:

Center data:

*First remove the duplicate centers (some centers are in more than one network, but we only wanted to plot unique centers per state)
* Also add count of centers for each state (includes both network members and collaborators)
```{r}
mapdata <- centers %>%
  distinct(center, .keep_all = T) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(center_count = n()) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

Next - some states don't have any data (because they don't have any centers - e.g. alaska). If dataset is used as is, those states will just be holes in the map.

So you need to add rows for those states (use `right_join()` so you get all the rows in `mapdata` PLUS all the rows in `state`)
```{r}
mapdata <- mapdata %>% 
  right_join(state_lookup, by = "state")
```

New state rows have center_count = NA, so you next need to replace them with 0
```{r}
mapdata$center_count <- replace_na(mapdata$center_count, 0)
```

Collaborator data:

* We don't need state names for the collaborator data, since we'll just plot those points on the map.
* We do need to count the number of collaborators per state so we can size the points accordingly. 
* Some of the points are really close together (e.g. OHSU and PSU), so they're not discernible with the small size of the final figure. I decided to just make those points bigger so it's easier to tell that there's more than one. (Could also have grouped them by city, but again, short on time)
* (`add_count()` is a handy shortcut that wraps `group_by()` and `mutate()` to add a column of counts)
```{r}
point_data <- point_data %>% 
  add_count(state_abb)
```

## Plotting, version 1

Again, this is basically just a big plot of latitude & longitude

`geom_map()` reads the shape coordinates from a reference map

* map = the reference map (in this case, `fifty_states` from the {fiftystater} package) 
* map_id = the column in your dataset that refers to the reference map shapes

`coord_map()` scales the plot so it looks like the map projections we're used to seeing (curvature of earth, etc.)

```{r}
mapdata %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_map(aes(map_id = state, fill = center_count), 
           map = fifty_states, color = "white") +
  geom_point(data = point_data, 
             aes(x = long, y = lat, size = n), 
             shape = 21, fill = "darkorange") +
  expand_limits(x = fifty_states$long, y = fifty_states$lat) +
  coord_map() +
  scale_fill_viridis(breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15), 
                     name = "Network centers\nper state") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  scale_size_continuous(breaks = c(1, 2), 
                        range = c(3,5), 
                        name = "Collaborators\nper state") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10))

# ggsave("vizome_map.png", height = 5, width = 9)
```

## Plotting, version 2

It's hard to emphasize the states where we have influence when the states with no centers are also colored.

So in this version, I kept the states with 0 centers in a separate dataframe so I can color them grey in the plot.

First I did the same as above to get center_count for each state:
```{r}
mapdata2 <- centers %>%
  distinct(center, .keep_all = T) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(center_count = n()) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

Then instead of filling in the states with no data, I created a separate dataframe with those states.

I don't need counts for these because I'm not looking to fill based on count - I just need them to show up.
```{r}
zero_states <- state_lookup %>% 
  anti_join(mapdata2, by = "state")
```

Now I plot two `geom_map()` layers:

* one for the states with centers, filled according to center count, same as above
* another layer with the zero-count states, all colored grey (outside of `aes()` because not linked to data)
```{r}
  ggplot() +
  geom_map(data = mapdata2,
           aes(map_id = state, fill = center_count), 
           map = fifty_states, color = "white") +
  geom_map(data = zero_states,
           aes(map_id = state),
           map = fifty_states, 
           fill = "lightgrey",
           color = "white") +
  geom_point(data = point_data, 
             aes(x = long, y = lat, size = n), 
             shape = 21, fill = "darkorange") +
  expand_limits(x = fifty_states$long, y = fifty_states$lat) +
  coord_map() +
  scale_fill_viridis(breaks = c(1, 7, 13), 
                     name = "Network centers\nper state\n(grey = 0)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  scale_size_continuous(breaks = c(1, 2), 
                        range = c(3,5), 
                        name = "Collaborators\nper state") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10))

# ggsave("vizome_map_withgrey.png", height = 5, width = 9)
```
